## How to play the Maven Pizza Challenge
For the **[Maven Pizza Challenge](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-pizza-challenge)**, you’ll be playing the role of a BI Consultant hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey. You've been hired to help the restaurant use data to improve operations, and just received the following note:

_Welcome aboard, we're glad you're here to help!_

_Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. We've been collecting transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. Hoping you can analyze the data and put together a report to help us find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently._

_Here are some questions that we'd like to be able to answer:_

* _What days and times do we tend to be busiest?_
* _How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?_
* _What are our best and worst selling pizzas?_
* _What's our average order value?_
* _How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? (we have 15 tables and 60 seats)_

_That's all I can think of for now, but if you have any other ideas I'd love to hear them – you're the expert!_

_Thanks in advance,_

_Mario Maven (Manager, Plato's Pizza)_

For this challenge, your task is to **build a single-page dashboard based on Mario's email to help him improve the restaurant's operations.**
